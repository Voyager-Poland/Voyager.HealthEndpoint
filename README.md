## 🤨 About <a name = "about"></a>

Just after registering services and mapping the endpoint the service for a health check is ready. After simply adding support specific to the application, it allows testing the readiness of the application for the needs of traffic management services. The interface can be used by Kubernetes, Supervisor, or any solution that probes over HTTP. It could be used in any kind of .Net Core application that provides an HTTP interface.

The library is very light. It doesn't include any new dependencies except those abstract declarations that already have been included in projects supporting HTTP interfaces. Registration is carried out based on framework receipt so the new interface will have been seen by other standard tools like Swagger. 

The library doesn't require developers any specific for probing knowledge. It's just an extension that can be used by any kind of health check policy. Depending on an override of one method it can check the connection to any database, could test access to a filesystem, or an external connection, and check any kind of rules validating that the application is ready to work.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
