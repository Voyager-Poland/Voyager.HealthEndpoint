## 🤨 About <a name = "about"></a>

Just after registering services and mapping the endpoint the service for a health check is ready. After simply adding support specific to the application, it allows testing the readiness of the application for the needs of traffic management services. The interface can be used by Kubernetes, Supervisor, or any solution that probes over HTTP. It could be used in any kind of .Net Core application that provides an HTTP interface.

The library is very light. It doesn't include any new dependencies except those abstract declarations that already have been included in projects supporting HTTP interfaces. Registration is carried out based on framework receipt so the new interface will have been seen by other standard tools like Swagger. 

The library doesn't require developers any specific for probing knowledge. It's just an extension that can be used by any kind of health check policy. Depending on an override of one method it can check the connection to any database, could test access to a filesystem, or an external connection, and check any kind of rules validating that the application is ready to work.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name ="getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

The library coperate with the WebApplicationBuilder or HostApplicationBuilder. By the default the hosts solutions implement required DependencyInjention.

## 🔧 How configure test health check  <a name = "#health"></a>

Adding the NuGet to a project:

```.NET CLI 
dotnet add package Voyager.HealthEndpoint
```

The default services are installed to the serivce catalog:

```C# 
// use the namespace
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
		...
		public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
		{
			// another servicess
			...
			// Add the line
			services.AddHealthServices();		
		}
		...
```
Is requered adding the endpoint mapping to the pipline:

```C# 
// use the namespace
using  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder
...
		public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
		{
			...
			app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
			{
				// add this line
				app.MapHealth("/health");
				...
			});
		}
```

After running the application it is possible to start probing:

```cmd 
curl http://localhost:5200/health
```
## 🔧 How to test readiness <a name = "readiness">

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
